Excellent! üéâ I'm glad it's working perfectly now. Let me summarize everything that was implemented and fixed from the beginning:

üìã Complete Summary of Changes
üéØ Initial Request
You wanted: "After drag and drop or adding image block to the canvas, after double clicking it, it needs to open a popup asking to add from existing image or upload new image"

üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Image Selection Modal Implementation
1. Created ImageSelectionModal.tsx
Purpose: Complete modal interface for image selection
Features:
Two tabs: "Existing Images" and "Upload New"
Grid display of existing images
Drag & drop upload functionality
URL conversion helpers (relative ‚Üî absolute)
2. Enhanced Canvas.tsx
Added: onImageDoubleClick prop to handle image double-clicks
Added: getDisplayImageUrl() helper for proper image URL display
Fixed: Image rendering with correct URLs in canvas
3. Integrated with EmailStudio.tsx
Added: Modal state management
Added: Image selection handlers
Added: Modal trigger on image double-click
4. Enhanced Backend API
Added: GET /api/images endpoint to list existing images
Enhanced: File upload handling with proper validation
üîß Phase 2: Image Display Issues & Fixes
5. Canvas Display Issues
Problem: Images not showing after upload Solution:

Fixed URL conversion between relative (/uploads/...) and absolute (http://localhost:3001/uploads/...)
Added getDisplayImageUrl() helper function
6. Preview Display Issues
Problem: Images not showing in email preview Solution:

Enhanced generatePreview() function with URL replacement
Fixed preview iframe content generation
7. Template Persistence Issues
Problem: Images disappeared after save/reload Root Cause: Backend was mixing HTML and JSON storage incorrectly

Major Fix:

// BEFORE: Mixed storage causing confusion
body: email_body || body  // Sometimes HTML, sometimes JSON

// AFTER: Clear separation
body: JSON.stringify(components)  // Always JSON components
email_body: htmlContent           // Always HTML for emails

üöÄ Phase 3: Email Sending Implementation
8. Template Save/Load Logic
Problem: Backend storing HTML instead of JSON components Solution:

Modified POST/PUT endpoints to always store JSON components in body field
Added validation to ensure JSON components are preserved
Added conversion logic for email sending
9. JSON-to-HTML Conversion
Added: Helper function in backend to convert JSON components to HTML:

function convertComponentsToHTML(componentsJson) {
  // Converts JSON components back to HTML for email sending
}

10. Email Publishing Issues
Problem: "Failed to publish template" errors Solution:

Fixed PUT endpoint validation (was too strict)
Added proper JSON‚ÜíHTML conversion before email sending
Fixed all email sending endpoints to use converted HTML
üìß Phase 4: Email Image Display (Final Solution)
11. Base64 Approach (First Attempt)
Images converted to base64 for email embedding
Issue: Many email clients block data URLs
12. CID Attachments (Final Solution) ‚≠ê
Problem: Images not showing in actual emails Root Cause: Email clients block external URLs and base64 data URLs

Final Solution - CID (Content-ID) Attachments:

// BEFORE: Base64 (blocked by email clients)
src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo..."

// AFTER: CID attachments (works everywhere)
src="cid:image1"  // + actual file attached to email

Why CID Works:

‚úÖ Universal compatibility - works in Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.
‚úÖ No size limits like base64
‚úÖ Always displays - no "Show Images" button needed
‚úÖ Professional standard - used by all major email services
üîë Key Technical Implementations
Frontend Architecture:
Canvas: Drag & drop with image double-click handling
Modal: Tabbed interface with upload/selection
State Management: Proper component state and URL handling
Preview: Real-time preview with correct image URLs
Backend Architecture:
Storage: JSON components in body field for editing persistence
Conversion: Dynamic JSON‚ÜíHTML conversion for email sending
Email Service: CID attachment processing for reliable image display
API Endpoints: Proper separation of concerns
Image URL Handling:
Storage: Relative paths (/uploads/image.png)
Display: Absolute URLs (http://localhost:3001/uploads/image.png)
Email: CID references (cid:image1 + file attachment)
üéØ Final Working Flow
Add Image: Double-click opens modal ‚Üí select/upload ‚Üí image appears in canvas
Save Template: JSON components stored in database
Preview: Images show correctly with absolute URLs
Reload: Images persist because JSON components are preserved
Send Email: JSON converted to HTML, images attached as CID ‚Üí Perfect display in all email clients
The key breakthrough was understanding that email images need to be file attachments with CID references, not embedded base64 or external URLs. This is the professional standard that ensures images display reliably across all email platforms! üöÄ
